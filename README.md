# Doubly-Linked-List

This project involves implementing a Doubly Linked List (DLL) in Python, showcasing its structure and the key operations typically used in data manipulation. The code is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates how a DLL can be used as an underlying data structure for more complex data types such as queues.

Project Structure

doubly_linked_list.py: The Python script implementing the Doubly Linked List with standard methods like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Features

Node Structure: Each node has pointers to both the previous and the next node, allowing for efficient two-way traversal.
Insertion: Methods for adding elements to the beginning, end, or at a specific position in the list.
Deletion: Functions for removing elements from the list based on value or position.
Traversal: Methods for iterating through the list from both the head and tail.
Utility Methods: Functions to check if the list is empty, get the length of the list, and display the list's contents.
